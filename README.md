# aerospike-docker-swarmTemplate to use with Docker Swarm Mode (Docker v. 1.12+). This is not the same as Standalone Swarm (old Swarm).# Requirements* Docker Engine 1.13+ (due to Compose v3.2)# Usage```bashdocker stack deploy -c aerospike.yml aerospike```# Starting from scratch1. Install docker-machine via [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)1. Create your VMs:      `$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox node1`      `$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox node2`1. Configure a node as Swarm Manager:      `$ docker-machine ssh node1`      `docker@node1:~$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr <swarm_advertise_ip>`    There should be a 192.168.99.0/24 subnet created just for inter-VM networking. Use this address for your `<swarm_advertise_ip>` 1. The previous command will output a command and token for every other docker node to join as workers:    ```    Swarm initialized: current node (bvz81updecsj6wjz393c09vti) is now a manager.    To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:    docker swarm join  --token <token> <swarm_advertise_ip>    ```    `docker-machine ssh node2`    `docker@node2:~$ docker swarm join  --token <token> <swarm_advertise_ip>`1. Verify your cluster:      `docker@node1:~$ docker node ls`# Aerospike.conf changesDue to docker containers deploying with multiple NICS, you'd need to lock down the interface used for Aerospike networking.This is done by specifying `address eth0` for each of the following within the network stanza:* service* heartbeat* fabric
